I am an architect in training, a designer and maker, an author, playwright, vocalist, and cultural anthropologist living in the Pacific Northwest.
My current research is on Lessons from Freedom Towns and Colonies: from Poverty to Prosperity. I am intensly curious how the formerly enslaved were able to go from the rags on their backs to land, homes, economic sustainability.
As an author I am midway through a book of poetry and about 1/4 of the way through a screenplay set in British Colonial North America.
As a recording artist I am three songs from the end of my first solo album. It consists of 13 songs of which I wrote six. The album contains the major musical pieces from my last performance piece entitled "Blackbird Calendar".
